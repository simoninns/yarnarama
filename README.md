# Yarnarama - A yarn holder for knitting
## Overview
Yaranarama is a yarn holder for the discerning knitting engineer.  It features a fully bearing supported wool spindle mounted on a weighted based, as well as a built-in yarn guide.

This project is GPLv3 open-source and was designed with the assistance my daughter who is an enthusiastic knitter.

## Printing instructions
The model has been printed and tested on the Prusa MK3S/MMU2S printer using Prusament PETG filament. All parts fit the standard print bed.

You will need 5x M3x5.7 threaded inserts (along with 5 M3x10mm screws) and 1x 608-2Z ball bearing.  The base is weighted using 5x M20 washers (DIN9021 - id=22, od=60, h=3.5).

When mounting the washers in the base it is advisable to pad any gap at the top of the bearings to stop them moving around.  Some foam tape or small bits of foam will work well.

### Recommended print settings

Print settings (for Prusa Slicer) are the same for all included parts:

* Material: PETG
* Layer: 0.30mm (Draft)
* Infill: 25%
* No supports required

Note: 0.30mm is used for fast print speed.  You can also use 0.20mm (Quality) if you like smoother looking prints.

## Assembly

Print all the parts.

Insert the heat set inserts in the base (4x) and spool base (1x).

Push fit the bearing into the base of the spool holder.

Put an M3x10mm screw into the bearing holder and then push fit through the spindle and into the bearing.

Place 5 washers into the base, add some foam to the top washer to stop it moving when assembled.

Screw the spool base into place using 2x M3x10mm screws.

Place the spool shaft onto the spool base and screw into place using the central M3x10mm screw (in the bearing holder)

Glue the guide rail into the provided slot of the guide (using a small amount of superglue)

Screw the guide into the base using 2x M3x10mm screws.
