# Yarnarama - A yarn holder for knitting
## Overview
Yaranarama is a yarn holder for the discerning knitting engineer.  It features a fully bearing supported wool spindle mounted on a weighted based, as well as a built-in yarn guide.

This project is GPLv3 open-source and was designed with the assistance my daughter who is an enthusiastic knitter.

## Printing instructions
The model has been printed and tested on the Prusa MK3S/MMU2S printer using Prusament PETG filament. All parts fit the standard print bed.

You will need 5x M3x5.7 threaded inserts (along with 5 M3x10mm screws) and 1x 608-2Z ball bearing.  The base is weighted using 5x M20 washers (DIN9021 - id=22, od=60, h=3.5).

When mounting the washers in the base it is advisable to pad any gap at the top of the bearings to stop them moving around.  Some foam tape or small bits of foam will work well.

### Recommended print settings

Print settings (for Prusa Slicer) are the same for all included parts:

* Material: PETG
* Layer: 0.30mm (Draft)
* Infill: 25%
* No supports required

Note: 0.30mm is used for fast print speed.  You can also use 0.20mm (Quality) if you like smoother looking prints.

## Assembly
